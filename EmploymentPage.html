                            <p>I began my coding journey in a classroom setting with C++. My enthusiasm for technology quickly propelled me to explore Python. As I honed my skills, my interest gravitated towards the complexities of machine learning. This natural progression led me to the realms of backend development. Along the way, I acquired a deep understanding of cloud technologies and even earned a certification as an AWS Cloud Practitioner. Today, I'm well-versed in various tools and platforms including Google Cloud, REST APIs, and databases. You can look at these skills broken down by clicking the skills below. </p>

                        <p>I started my first every introduction into web development by creating a web app at the tamu hackathon here back in january and sense then I have been hooked.
                            From there I progressed towards learning both backend and front end frameworks. I learned express through code academy and projects as well as full stack design and react through <a target="_blank" href="https://scrimba.com/#overview">Scrimba</a>,
                        and have created portfolio which you can find <a href="https://github.com/Mackay-Fisher/React-Portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>. I have sense had an internship in full stack design where I further learned how to work with backends like mongo db dynamo db as well as cloud functions.
                    Then at this internship I was introduced into react native which then showed me the wonderful world of app development. I have sense been perusing app development in my free time and continue to expand on my skills in this field. At the moment I have knowledge in frontend frameworks like React and Angular as well as Express.js, Node.js, Firebase and Google Cloud backend. I have begun to work on my own health and fitness app and continue to expand my knowledge base.</p>

                        <p> Machine learning has been the newest and most exciting field of interest. I have experience with reinforcement learning which you can see through the previous projects section but I also
                            have begun to work on deep learning neural networks as well. I find it fascinating to see the parameterization and use of smaller KNN models all the way to activation functions like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning" target="_blank">Relu</a>. I have even 
                            been lucky enough to begin research with a professor in the data science department who is helping me construct neural networks on function analysis (read more about it <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~bonito/Publications/Preprints/2022_BBDP_Learning.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). I am constantly amazed at what can be done with machine leaning and fully believe it will power the future of computer science and mathematics and I will continue to grow my skills to hopefully be a contributor to the field in the future.

                        <p> For me software engineering means the study of algorithms and data structures sense I have taken 221 last semester I found these very fascinating and began to put in a lot of time outside of class learning them but also having fun with deeper function creation.
                            I then took CSCE 411 over the summer where I was able to see form a proof format the importance of these functions and structures and what they really mean and I loved it. Further diving deeper into lower level programming and understanding how these smaller function create the very same operations we use daily. 
                            I always want to know how things work and breaking down the software has lead me to understand more the extent and the importance of how these programs scale to the higher level function we use today. I currently peer teach for the CSCE 312 class here and continue to dive deeper into how the systems we use everyday work.
