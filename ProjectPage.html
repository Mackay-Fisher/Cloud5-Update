                    <p>Perfect Snake was my first introduction to machine learning and focused on the use of DNQ agents as well as randomly generated actions to create a desired path to capture randomly generated elements on a created playing board.
                    Then created a systematic reward system in order to showcase a properly managed DNQ reward system, I utilized the Pytorch library in order to unitize an agent class on a pygame snake game that I created my self in order to give access to the possible controls.
                    The used Q-learning agent in order to create a systems to train both short term and long-term training adjusting shallow neural networks with as well as depth for further optimization. This created a reinforcement learning model that tracked both short term and long term decision making to create
                    optimal decision trees. Then utilized Matplotlib to showcase real timed training with scores and iteration to show progression to higher and higher scores as the model progressed.

                    <p>I started my step in data science with my first project in web scrapping; I was interested in this field and wanted to dive in every sense when I came to college. I started by getting an academy account and working on their portfolio projects. This entailed creating a Python script to systematically read through nested HTML elements to gather and collect data into a pandas data frame. Then, I used the Numpy and Pandas library to pull out trends within the data. I focused on distribution costs yields and associated costs. </p>

                    <p>Working with the analysis, I then began to isolate critical metrics that would impact the profitability of chocolate manufacturing. I create a decision hierarchy where the metric that most increases profitability would be the most heavily weighted attribute. I used location, expense, manufacturing, cost quality, and sales force to distribute the most primal areas and styles for portability. Then, I graphed the difference using matplotlib line to showcase the differences in each area. Check it out below!</p>

                    <p>In the next step towards machine learning I began to work with a reinforcement learning model, this was particularly based on the open ai gym model for ai mario, I followed tutorial videos on how to use stable baselines before then working on creating my own algorithm. I started by using vector stacking to view the imaging of the level and well as a finite move list to help build an optimal path decision tree. I then worked with a consistent reward system based on distance to help motivate the model to progress throughout the level. Then as the iteration continued I stored them in long term and short term memory to build a width and deep neural network to optimize efficiency. I then utilized the Stable Baseline PPo model to execute the callback of these iterations and add them to my model which then led to a trial process that was able to finish the first level of mario.</p>

                    <p>This was a professional project I had during my internship focused on creating temporary instances of networked websites so they could experience the use of our platform before purchasing. I used bitbucket pipelines HTML/CSS react and express as the primary runners of this project before creating networking events through Google Cloud to link these web servers together and Firebase to store data. I worked with HTTP requests to make sure all of these websites worked cohesively together and worked on ui to be consistent across three different web apps. </p>

                    <p>I then worked by further creating cloud infrastructure to authorize access and temporarily making these web apps with cloud function on timer-based distribution. This allowed for dynamic changes by the user on any particular web app to have the changes carried over and tracked with a unique database on spin-up and allowed access similar to that of their website. This then led to enhanced user traffic and worked to create a better integration of our native elements embedded within the trial service. There is no repository for this project because Iâ€™m not allowed to share it.</p>
