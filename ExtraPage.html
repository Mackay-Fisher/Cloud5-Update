                    <p>This was a tool I created at the hackathon to better identity and educate people on the risk of using certain medication with one another as well as connected to the library of medicine and common drug names in order to map the best treatment as well to avoid major damage.
                        This tool was also pared with a front end on how to avoid mixing medications that shouldn't be mixed and what to look for in order to help those avoid these problems as improper medication taking is the leading cause of medical malpratcice and incedential death in healthcare.
                        This tool was aimed to educate and help counter the risks of these medication uses.

                    <p> These past two years I've also been a part of big even where I'm, able to give back to the local community of bryan alongside my friends. My first year doing so I was able to help a very nice couple re mulch and landscape their back yard 
                        it was very impactful to see just how happy we made these two doing work that they had been putting of themselves. The next year I help again similarly mulching people yards, I always love to see how the smallest task like landscaping can have a serious impact on the happiness of the
                        people we are helping and I'm always excited to participate in this community event each year. <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Check it out</a>
